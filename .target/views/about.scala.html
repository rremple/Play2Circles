    <p>From <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Wikipedia</a>:

    <blockquote>
        Venn diagrams or set diagrams are diagrams that show all hypothetically 
        possible logical relations between a finite collection of sets 
        (aggregation of things). Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by 
        John Venn. They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as 
        illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, 
        linguistics and computer science (see logical connectives).
    </blockquote>

    <p>Although Venn diagrams are meant to be abstract representations of sets
    and set relationships, people often intentionally scale the shapes. 
    Larger sets are represented by larger shapes and larger intersections 
    are represented by greater overlaps of those shapes. But in general, 
    folks only take this idea part of the way. Although shapes and 
    intersections are often scaled, in general the scaling is "eyeballed" 
    and not calculated mathematically. This tool allows a user to specify 
    precise sizes of three sets and the intersections of each pair of sets.
